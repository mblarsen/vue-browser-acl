- Routes can have asyncronious checks too (see [`/src/router`](src/router/index.js))
- Different user types has different permissions (e.g. group or owner of resource)
- Use of rules vs policies (see [`src/index.js`](src/index.js#L44))
- Use of `beforeAll` (see [`PostPolicy`](src/index.js#L18))
- Enable logging `localStorage.debug="demo*"` then refresh
